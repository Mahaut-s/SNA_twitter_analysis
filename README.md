# Twitter Analysis












CONCLUSION :


In conclusion, this analysis canâ€™t show polarization but helps us to identify how people are talking about a recent mass shooting. To do so, we use the Louvain community iGraph algorithm that allows us to identify clusters with mostly pro-gun control tweets and to some extent anti-gun control tweets.

To further analyze our results, we compare them to existing surveys which were made by experts using machine learning to analyze reactions on Twitter about the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting (Wang, N., Varghese, B., & Donnelly, P. (2017). A Machine Learning Analysis of Twitter Sentiment to the Sandy Hook Shootings. ) We can notice the recurrences of some hashtags on Twitter after a mass shooting like #PrayFor  or #guncontrol  that builds a social media culture that automatically gives people some conventions while expressing their emotions after an act of violence.
